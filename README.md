# LLMOps Courses & Lessons (Geo Bounty Draft)

## What this is
I’m **Thomas Freestone** and I’m compiling a curated list of **LLMOps learning resources** for Geo.  
I’m using AI to help brainstorm, structure, and format the list, but **I’m personally responsible for reviewing and finalizing what gets included**.

## Goal
Turn the best public LLMOps material into a Geo-friendly catalog of:
- **Courses** (major platforms/communities/tools)
- **Lessons** (units within each course, ordered)
- **Topic tags** (LLMOps taxonomy)
- Optional **People** (authors/instructors/maintainers when clearly attributable)

## Current status (initial draft only)
Right now this repo contains **only an initial draft list**:
- a first pass at “what should count as a Course”
- an initial set of Lesson URLs per Course

This is **not audited yet**, and some links may not be the best entry point for a learner.

## Next steps (manual audit plan)
I will manually audit and refine the list by:
1) **Verifying every link**
   - ensure it loads correctly and is stable
   - replace fragile/over-specific links with better entry points when needed

2) **Selecting the best entry point for each lesson**
   - prefer “Getting Started” / overview pages before deep technical references
   - prefer canonical docs/labs over random mirrors or secondary blog posts

3) **Normalizing structure**
   - stable IDs (`course_id`, `lesson_id`)
   - consistent lesson ordering (`lesson_num`)
   - consistent topic tags across all courses/lessons

4) **Removing weak/duplicate items**
   - keep only widely recognized, high-quality material
   - reduce redundancy across courses where it doesn’t add learning value

## Link selection rules (what I’m aiming for)
When multiple URLs exist, I will prefer links that are:
- **Official/canonical**
- **Stable**
- **Beginner-appropriate as an entry point**
- **Actionable** (docs/labs with clear steps)
