Need to match csv column headers to the existing property labels in Geo where possible eg change course_url to web_url; who_they_are to Description; and so on.

Tags are best for table filtering and then sorting where categories are not enough. Add new columns like Skills, Roles.

Determine if the Goal of the course is salient enough to be added as a property.
